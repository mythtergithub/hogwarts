# Hogwarts: A Vanilla JavaScript Demo Project

This project is a demonstration of using vanilla JS in creating a pseudo-client-server web application.

The JS syntax used in this demo project follows ES6.

The design is not the focus in this project but more on functionality.

Data is taken from two local JSON files: students.json and families.json

To properly run this app, use your local web server (i.e. XAMPP), otherwise the Fetch API won't work.
